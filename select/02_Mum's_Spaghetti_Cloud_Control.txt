C'mon, get up
I know that's what you want
Sun rise, sun down
Let's the long way round
There's a place that I know
Waiting for a chance to go
I never wanna be without you
I'll let you roll your [?] dear

It's alright 'cause I'm going anyway
(What you say, say, say...)
You can do what you wanna anyway
(What you say, say, say...)
But sometimes doesn't matter anyway
I do it every day, and probably I'm insane
By the time you change your mind
And you say you want it
It's free

Let's go, hey [?]
We'll ride it coast to coast
I won't forget
The things that I miss most
And I know you can see
Remembering the shadow of me
Looking back at all the mess
Most of these and the rest

It's alright 'cause I'm going anyway
(What you say, say, say...)
You can do what you wanna anyway
(What you say, say, say...)
But sometimes doesn't matter anyway
I do it every day, and probably I'm insane
By the time you change your mind
And you say you want it
It's free

Tonight, it's nice
We'll do whatever we like
Right now it's hard
We're taking everything off
When the place gets so hard
Everybody take your clothes off
And if we do it all together
Is everybody feeling better?

I'm thinking lately
If I get to eighty
Then I'm with my lady
Still together maybe (maybe, maybe, maybe)
A family
In another country
Are you high above me?
Are you still inside me?
'Cause I keep forgetting
Mum's spaghetti
